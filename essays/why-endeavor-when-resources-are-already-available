## We all have experienced with creating a webpage
In today’s technology-heavy world, most people have experienced creating at least one webpage whether that is choosing a background image of the Facebook page, a profile picture for the Instagram account, or typing in a list of achievements in a LinkedIn portfolio. By using these pre-implemented platforms, it is very easy for us to pick and choose how we want to decorate our website uniquely. However, if we have to create and design our webpage from a piece of blank, scratch paper, that is a different story.

## Plagiarism works differently...
One professor from one class that I took before once said that plagiarism works differently in Computer Science. How is it different? You definitely want to copy and paste when a set of codes is already invented by someone. Why endeavor when resources are already available? Some people might have opposing views; however, I definitely agree with the professor as I am not an inventor. 

## Semantic UI is simple but too simple
My first week of working with HTML reminded me of the past when I first started using the internet; all the texts and images were a block of patches. However, now that the internet offers with tons of information, users tend to seek pleasing visuals. I often close the browser when I am invited with an endless line of texts without any appealing images or fascinating animations. A platform like Semantic UI can excel in the design aspect of the webpage without spending too much time coding for each aspect of the web components. As I have learned HTML and CSS before I was introduced to Semantic UI, it was very simple to use, and I was amazed by the various components that could satisfy user’s appetite. However, it also had negative sides especially because I was not familiar with how to work with layouts and some other features. Sometimes the code was too simple to get into details of how I wanted it to be.
