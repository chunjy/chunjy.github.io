## Define Programmer

Who do you consider a great programmer? The one who excels in one specific programming language, or experienced in various languages? I felt like I was behind when I declared my major as a Computer Science. Back in high school, I have been exposed to the HTML programming language and participated in Cyber Fast Track where I learned about cybersecurity. That was the sole major-related experience that I had. After exploring around the schools for about three semesters switching majors several times, I finally decided to learn more about Computer Science a year ago. Learning basic Java programming language was enjoyable at first. However, I began to feel I never really acquired one specific language as I continued to explore computer languages in different avenues. I asked, “am I on the right track?”


## Is JavaScript better?

After learning Java for a year, I have challenged myself to learn the C and C++ programming languages for a semester and as of now, I am learning JavaScript. People might have different perspectives depending on what programming languages they have learned in the past. However, spending two weeks learning JavaScript has eliminated my agitation of not acquiring one specific language before I moved onto the next. Having basic knowledge of the programming language, I was challenged yet it was not too difficult to follow JavaScript. So far, JavaScript is very user-friendly and is relatively easy to understand. Therefore, it was less challenging compared to understanding the other languages.

## Athletic Software Engineering

Athletic Software Engineering is one of the best ways to learn more about a new programming language. By having a weekly module and practicing Workout of the Day, students can gradually build their new language skills as long as they are proactive. Having a time limit puts the pressure on students which pushes them to sprint and prepares them for future time-limited interview questions. I am looking forward to learning how to work as a group and to becoming a true developer and a programmer who understands the environment fully by the time I leave the classroom.
