## Before The Journey
My friends and I on a small island of Hawaii sat down together on miles of golden sands and sentimentalized over the blue ocean. Our curiosity towards the dreamland over the horizon stimulated us to build a majestic ship, and new learning and insights along the software engineering career became the significant components of it. The ship was soon filled with a diverse group of friends, having different cuisine, ethnicity, and interest, but there was one thing that we all shared: the target destination. We wanted to deviate from this sheltered and isolated place and expose ourselves to a wide range of learning experiences.

## Building A Ship Takes Time
Building a ship takes time. A lot of time. If we constructed our ship from pieces of steel or wood, it would have taken us years before we even departed. Fortunately, we used the [meteor-example-form-react template](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-example-form-react) as a base for our final project, which allowed us to save time from coding everything from scratch and repeating codes or functions. We could customize our ship by having efficient design patterns such as constructors with prototypes and manage the project for its advanced simplicity and readability.

## Navigating The World
From time to time, I was afraid to be engulfed by the giant waves and instantaneously shivered at the center of the ship. Despite the horror, I had to place myself on the front deck with the courage to wrestle against adversity. Splashâ€”I squeezed my eyes tightly then gradually opened them. I discovered that the person who is not afraid of failures acquires knowledge and skills from her experience, which will become a foundation of her success; hence I am ready to walk confidently to the front deck of the world today.
