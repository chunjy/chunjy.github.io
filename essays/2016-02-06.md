I would’ve arrived at a different resolution if I were to revisit the Hawaii Stock Market Simulation program with $100,000. I decided to invest in renowned companies, such as Amazon and Netflix, as well as a few lesser-known corporations. With the collaborative effort, my team placed first in the Growth Division with a positive return of $2,140. I felt a rush of excitement as the overall value of my investment increased, and I wished that return of investment was reality.

## Was my victory just by mere luck?

Some people follow their gut when making decisions, but I shy away from risk. When my friends asked for advice on buying stocks, they believed I was concealing a secret technique from them—I couldn’t give any advice. I simply chose popular corporations because of their noted performance. I felt weak after I pondered over what might be the right answer to my friends’ questions. Was my victory just by mere luck? I believed I earned my accomplishment. Did I not? I knew that I wouldn’t have followed the same method if I had participated in today’s volatile stock market.

## Discover solutions hidden in the data

To fight against my crippling risk aversion nature, I want to earn practical skills that the Computer Science major has to offer. I realized that the modern powerful instrument is not just about how much data one possesses, but also the ability to process and utilize those data. While the current knowledge I have is comforting, I need to learn how to escape my comfort zone and efficiently explore the rest of the extensive information.
