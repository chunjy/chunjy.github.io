It is very challenging to live as an F-1 international student to overcome a language barrier, to work for an organization, and to have a stable life in America. However, from learning basic English to graduating high school with great accomplishments, I have successfully adapted to different circumstances since when I arrived in Honolulu in 2012. I have had an opportunity to intern as well during high school and eventually succeeded with the significant merit scholarship for foreign students at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

In the summer of 2012, I came over from South Korea to Hawaii. My English skills were very limited, but I never declined to give up and maintained positivity. I also planned thoroughly throughout my student life and pushed myself to take advanced courses and to participate in diverse school activities. Learning a new language has opened up a lot of new opportunities for me such as internships, scholarships, and job opportunities.

By leading the Marching Band and Leo Club with a diverse group of students, I have smoothly combined the mix of individuals and extended myself to understand more about their cultures. I also learned to be open-minded as Iâ€™ve been constantly challenged by various standpoints. Despite the difficulty of earning an opportunity to work in the U.S., I plan to learn more deeply about Computer Science in Honolulu both by studying core subjects as well as procuring networking opportunities via campus experiences to hone my soft skills before I compete with others.
