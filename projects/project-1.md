   From inserting a card into an ATM to completing a transaction, a countless algorithms work together in the background. I have worked on a project of demonstrating simple transactions of bank operations in the class of ICS 212 – Program Structure. The main goal was to create an user-friendly interface and to collect and organize the users’ data in a singly linked list.

  By using the C programming language, I have created a program for the user to add, find, delete, and quit the program. The first step was to have an outline of the welcoming message and a menu with instructions on the screen. When the user chooses to perform a transaction, it asks for the account number, name, and address. The collected data is arranged in a singly linked list. Each operation was organized into a separate function and all operations were grouped into a different file for the purpose of the transaction and the department. The same project was written in C++ to acquire the basic syntax of the new programming language.

  I learned not only how to use both C and C++ programming languages, but also how to work with colleagues in the organization in a professional atmosphere. Improving both my technical and interpersonal skills has been a stepping stone to become a more competitive programmer in the near future. Scrutinizing the code from the top to the bottom to spot an error was a valuable experience as it advanced my knowledge of how each minor piece can adapt the way the program works as a whole.
